- Page components are server components, and we create server components by default
    - Create client compenents with `'use client'` directive when we want to use client-only functionality (e.g. hooks)
    - Never make a `page.tsx` component a client component unless explicitly instructed
- We create server actions by default, and we never create api routes
    - Use server actions to handle form submissions, data fetching, and other server-side logic
    - Make a server actions file at `app/actions.ts` to handle server actions for simple apps and create multiple files when it becomes complex
    - Generally import and invoke server actions only in page components and then pass it as a prop to a child component

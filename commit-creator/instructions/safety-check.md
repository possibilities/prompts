- Follow these instructions step-by-step:
    - Perform a safety and security check of the current repo changes
    - Look for the following unsafe scenarios:
        - Suspicious files or changes
        - Any credentials are present
        - Files are committed that should be ignored
        - Binaries are committed
        - Secrets accidentally embedded in code (e.g., API keys, tokens)
        - Executable scripts without shebang or unexpected permissions
        - Unexpected changes to configuration or dependency files (e.g., package-lock.json, requirements.txt)
    - When complete save file with the contents of the security check 
        - If no unsafe scenarios are present, save the summary as ./SUCCEEDED-SECURITY-CHECK.txt
        - If unsafe scenarios are present, save the summary as ./FAILED-SECURITY-CHECK.txt
    - If you need to save the commit message to a text file, use the /tmp directory (e.g., /tmp/commit_message.txt)

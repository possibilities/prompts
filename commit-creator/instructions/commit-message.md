- All changes are in the working tree and all info needed to create a commit message are in the conversation
- Analyze the changes and respond with ONLY the commit message text
    - No explanations
    - No additional commentary
    - Only the commit message itself should be returned
    - Avoid using the word "commit" in the message
- If you need to save the commit message to a text file, use the /tmp directory (e.g., /tmp/commit_message.txt).

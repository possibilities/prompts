description: Add release
---

We are going to make this node project releable on npmjs.org

Follow each step one-by-one:
- Copy the release script from ~/code/release-script/release.sh here into the current project
- Add release scripts to package.json like !`cat ~/code/release-script/package.json`
- Run `commit-composer` to create a commit with the release script. This can take a while so set a high timeout

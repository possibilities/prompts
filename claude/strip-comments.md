description: Strip comments
---

Search the repo for comments. Assess if they are critical or not. Leave any comments with links. Leave any comments about ignoring linting, formatting, or typechecking. Remove all comments other than those about ignoring (lint/typecheck/format) or having links or critical information to be included with the code.

If it helps to name identifiers differently to avoid comments, let's do that.
